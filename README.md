### **Rear Axle Power Distribution**

Initially, the rear wheels were powered through a **Bevel Gear**, but we later upgraded to a **Differential Gearbox** to improve efficiency and performance during turns.

---

#### **Bevel Gear**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e19661f-b921-4bea-9028-4e0274306ced" width="300"/>
</div>
</td>
<td width="50%">

A **bevel gear** is a type of gear where the axes of the two shafts intersect, and the tooth-bearing faces of the gears are conical. Bevel gears are commonly used to transfer motion between intersecting shafts at an angle, typically 90¬∞.

##### **How Bevel Gears Work**
- A driver gear transfers motion to a driven gear, which rotates an output shaft.
- The teeth of the gears are designed to mesh smoothly, transferring torque efficiently between the shafts.

##### **Advantages of Bevel Gears**
1. **Compact Design**: Suitable for space-constrained applications.
2. **Efficient Torque Transfer**: Provides reliable power transmission at angles.
3. **Versatility**: Can operate at angles other than 90¬∞ if needed.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Bevel gears were essential in the initial stages of our design, but they had limitations in terms of energy efficiency during turns.
---

#### **Differential Gearbox**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

A **differential gearbox** allows the wheels on the same axle to rotate at different speeds while receiving power from a single motor. This is crucial for smooth turning, where the outer wheel must travel a larger distance than the inner wheel.

##### **Advantages of Differential Gearbox**
1. **Smooth Turns**: Adapts to varying wheel speeds, ensuring efficient cornering.
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Reduces energy wastage by minimizing wheel slippage.
3. **Component Longevity**: Minimizes wear on tires and axles.

##### **How Differential Gears Work**
- Power from the motor is delivered to an input shaft.
- The differential splits the torque between the two wheels via bevel or spider gears inside the housing.
- During turns, the differential allows one wheel to spin faster than the other, ensuring smooth movement.

# üß† Program Infrastructure and Explanation ## üèÅ Round 1 Algorithm - Lap Completion

In **Round 1**, our robot **SMOKI** must autonomously complete **three laps** on a predefined track without the need for obstacle avoidance. To achieve precise navigation and lap counting, we have developed a robust algorithm that integrates image processing with control systems.

---

### üåê Algorithm Overview

1. **üì∏ Image Acquisition**:
   - The robot captures real-time images of the track using its onboard camera.

2. **üé® Color Space Conversion**:
   - Captured images are converted from the **RGB** color space to the **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)** color space.
   - The HSV color space is chosen for its effectiveness in color segmentation, as it is less sensitive to lighting variations.

3. **üîç Color Segmentation and Orientation Determination**:
   - Using predetermined HSV ranges, the algorithm isolates the **blue** and **orange** line segments on the track.
   - During the first run, the robot checks whether the blue line appears before the orange line or vice versa.
   - **Orientation Determination**:
     - If the blue line comes before the orange line, the robot sets its orientation accordingly.
     - This initial orientation check ensures the robot follows the track in the correct direction.

4. **üìè Line Detection and Lap Counting**:
   - The **Hough Line Transform** method is applied to detect lines within the segmented images.
   - The robot counts the detected lines to keep track of laps.
   - **Lap Completion**:
     - After counting **12 lines** (corresponding to three laps), the robot initiates a predetermined delay and then stops.

5. **‚öôÔ∏è Position Correction Using PID Control**:
   - Before setting the orientation, a **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller** calculates the error.
   - **Error Calculation**:
     - The error is determined by the difference between the distances measured by sensors on the left and right sides of the robot (i.e., `error = left_distance - right_distance` or vice versa).
   - **Distance Maintenance**:
     - If the orientation is **right-based**, the robot maintains a **25 cm** distance from the right side.
     - If the orientation is **left-based**, it maintains a **25 cm** distance from the left side.
   - The PID controller adjusts the robot's steering to minimize the error, helping it stay centered on the track.

### üìñ Detailed Explanation

#### 1. üì∏ Image Acquisition and Preprocessing

- **Camera Input**:
  - High-resolution images are captured at regular intervals to ensure up-to-date visual data.
- **HSV Conversion**:
  - Conversion to HSV allows for more effective color thresholding.
  - HSV separates image intensity (Value) from color information (Hue and Saturation), making it easier to detect specific colors under varying lighting conditions.

#### 2. üé® Color Segmentation

- **HSV Thresholding**:
  - Specific HSV ranges for blue and orange are defined based on calibration.
  - **Blue Line Detection**:
    - Pixels within the blue HSV range are extracted.
  - **Orange Line Detection**:
    - Pixels within the orange HSV range are extracted.
- **Orientation Check**:
  - By analyzing the sequence of color segments (blue vs. orange), the robot determines its starting orientation.
  - This prevents incorrect lap counting due to starting in the wrong direction.

#### 3. üìè Line Detection with Hough Transform

- **Edge Detection**:
  - Preprocessing steps like Gaussian blur and Canny edge detection are applied to enhance line features.
- **Hough Line Transform**:
  - Detects straight lines by transforming points in image space to a parameter space.
  - Lines are identified based on the accumulation of intersecting points in the parameter space.
- **Lap Counting Logic**:
  - Each detected line crossing increments a counter.
  - The robot recognizes lap completion after counting **12** line crossings, accounting for both blue and orange lines over three laps.

- **Sensor Input**:
  - Distance sensors on both sides provide real-time measurements of the robot's position relative to the track edges.
- **Error Calculation**:
  - The error signal is the difference between the left and right distance measurements.
- **PID Controller**:
  - **Proportional Term (P)**: Reacts to the current error.
  - **Integral Term (I)**: Accounts for past errors to eliminate steady-state offset.
  - **Derivative Term (D)**: Predicts future error based on the rate of change.
- **Steering Adjustment**:
  - The PID output adjusts the steering angle to minimize the error.
  - Ensures the robot maintains the desired **25 cm** distance from the designated side.
- **Orientation-Based Behavior**:
  - **Right-Based Orientation**:
    - The robot favors the right side of the track.
  - **Left-Based Orientation**:
    - The robot favors the left side of the track.
